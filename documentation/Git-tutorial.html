		Terminal Notes; 
		Commands follow '$' in the terminal. Use Windows + R to run cmd.exe or use GitBash
		
		ls - list and displays the specific level our command line is sitting at. Directory is a collection of files. 
			$ls -a displays the hidden files as well. 
			
		cd Documents/ - stands for change directory. You can tab to find an existing directory or it will prompt you to be more specific. 
			$cd .. - brings you to the prior folder. 
			$cd ../.. - brings you up 2 levels. 
			
		mkdir 'directory name' - creates a folder if the name doesn't exist. You can move into the directory using the && filepath
		
		code . opens vs code with the directory you're in; you can directly type the directory path also.
			If there's an error for the code; code command not found; 

		touch index.html  - creates a file based on the file name and extension
		
			Tell Your Computer to Serve Your Webpage. Return to your terminal, then type in npx 
		
		npx serve . - this allows your computer to act as a server and respond to requests from other computers with the file you just created. CTRL + C to exit. Make sure that there is a space before the . to confirm it's the current file folder.

		mv - is move one or more files or directories; mv dir/file destination
			Ex $ mv middle_earth/the_shire/one.ring middle_earth/the_shire/frodo/one.ring
				You can use mv to rename your files
					Ex $ mv middle_earth/ Middle_Earth/
		
					rm -  command to delete one or more files or directories
					
		Git Notes
		Useful Terms:
		Directory - Folder, location, or address
		
		Terminal or Command Line - Interface for text commands
		
		CLI - Command Line Interface

		cd - Change Directory
		
		Code Editor - Word processor for writing code
		
		Repository - Project or the folder/place where your project is kept
		
		Github - a website to host your repositories online. 
		
		clone - bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like Github into a folder on your local machine
		
		add - track your files and see changes in Git
		
		commit - save your files in Git
		
		push - upload git commits to a remote repository like Github. 
		
		pull - download changes from remote repository to your local machine and the opposite of push

		
		Using GitBash Tool or command line; at project directory, run following commands
		git init
		code cd my_project
		my_project git init
		
		This creates a git repository master branch. 
		echo “hello world” 				displays hello world on the console
		echo “hello world” >> 	my_project.txt		puts this after whatever  you made. 

		git status 	gets the status on branch, it's red if there's no commits for everything untracked. 

		git add -A	or * commits everything and adds pending changes to be committed 
		
		git commit -m “string Add my file”	returns 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
		Create mode 10644 my_file.txt
		
		Use git status to check if there are any pending changes to the master to confirm the changes went through. 
		
		Remote Addresses; determines the location of where the repository is going. It can go to “main” or “master” depending on if you make the repository with the command line or the website direct. 
			Might have to create a Personal Access Token. Github has the instructions. Make sure to SAVE THE TOKEN SOMEWHERE; you will not be able to see it again and will have to generate a new token. 

		git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.
			creates link to origin repository
			
		git remote -v 	will display the (fetch) and (push) urls

		git branch 	lists the total git branches. 
		
		git branch -M main	main is the new name for the master. 

		git push origin main	command lists the details for the repository. 

		
		git config --global user.name “USERNAME” 		to change username
		
		Example: 
		This will ask for a Personal Access Token when making changes uploaded on GitHub. 

		$git init
		
		$ ls -a 		shows invisible files; 
		
		$ git add -A	adds everything into a package to ship
		
		$git status 	pending changes
		
		$git commit -m “First commit - change comments”
		
		$ git remote add origin https://github.com/CupofCoding/portfolio_school.git
		
			IF you get the following error, just go to your settings and account/email and uncheck the make email private box. 
			
		$ git push origin master	this gets the current master file/syncs with GitHub
		$code . 	open editor & change index.html file
		$ git add -A 	adds everything into a package to ship if you've made changes
		
		$ git commit -m "Adding new placeholder text"

		$git status 	check if changes went through/committed

		$git push origin master	this gets the current master file/syncs with GitHub

		
		git clone	clones repository to local machine;
			don't make clones inside of other clones where you run the possibility of running into errors. 

		git pull origin master 		this gets the current master file/syncs
			Note: If you make changes directly from Github, then your local files will be out of sync. 

		Making sure Repository is current: 
		git stash save			put the changes aside/last saved point with no changes

		git pull origin master 		get current code

		git stash pop 			add changes that were “stashed”

		git stash list			if you have made more than one stash save
			Returns: stash@{0}: WIP on dev: 1f6f8bb Commit message A
			stash@{1}: WIP on master: 50cf63b Commit message B
			
		git stash pop stash@{1}	to apply specific stash changes

		Pull request is done against the original fork; Pull requests add in your work later. Allows other developers to see changes that exist and approve the changes before merging. Fork is your remote copy of the main repository, you work on your “branch” then you add in your work against the main branch. 

		Example 2: GitHub Collaboration Exercise
		cd to default directory where you want your cloned repository then run command in terminal: 
		git clone https://github.com/YOUR-OWN-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-HERE/group-project.git
		
		git pull origin master 		syncs your file with the repository

		code .		 to bring up the code editor; 

		Select the index.html, look for the comment and add your own <div>&<h3> per the exercise. Make sure to save.

		Select style.css and do the same thing with the class name used in the <div>. Save changes.

		git status 		to check current status

		git add -A followed by git status to confirm changes to be committed

		git commit -m "comment"

		git push origin master	
			It will ask for your username/key. 
			Check GitHub to confirm that the repository was added. 

			This stops around Part Seven: Making Your First Pull Request. Whenever your group catches up then go through the merging process.
			
		Random Bits: 
		SourceTree; log server. Program that tracks branching.
